## Styles
This package uses cloudscape-design for common design tokens. In order to use the provided sass variables, we must use scss stylesheets. In order to ensure that end users do not need to compile these into css files for use in their applications, we are using the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) library cli. This simply converts scss files in palce into css files, referencing scss variables. There is one known limitation with this library, since react-components is in a mono-repo, and cloudscape design-tokens are a commonly referenced package, they are actually located at the root of the repo instead of in react-components. This means that when running the sass command to copile, sass cannot find the tokens. To work around this, we must import the design-tokens with a path directly to the node-modules directory, relative to the react-components directory.

Also, the styles are built and watched on start, so components should reference the converted css stylesheets, instead of the original scss ones.
